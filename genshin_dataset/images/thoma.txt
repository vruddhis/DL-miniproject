Thoma, a 4-star Pyro Polearm from Genshin Impact. The housekeeper of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, and a well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Friendly and approachable, Thoma fits in with the crowd easily wherever he is.
At first glance, he seems to be a very easygoing person, but he is in fact very responsible. He has an extraordinarily serious side, be it in his work or his interpersonal communications.
